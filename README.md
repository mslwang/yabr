# yabr

yabr (yet another book recommender) is a book recommendation website built with careful attention to form and functionality.

## Installation

yabr uses the package manager and virtual environment system [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to install and store packages. The package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) is also used to install other packages.

To create the virtual environment and install all relevant packages, type the following:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
